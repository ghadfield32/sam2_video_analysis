üöÄ Learning How Images can Build Efficient and Productive Data Science Projects üöÄ

Based on the invaluable Docker guidance from Rami Krispin, I wanted to create a structured repository that I could adjust for various projects. This template is designed to provide a robust and scalable environment that is GPU-enabled and can be easily adjusted to meet different project needs.

This Docker image template ensures you can hit the ground running with an organized and efficient setup. Whether it's for machine learning, data analysis, or any data-intensive tasks, this template aims to streamline your workflow and boost your productivity.

Check out the image template, contribute, or provide feedback here: https://github.com/ghadfield32/docker_dev_template


Remember, this is just one of many great resources out there. Docker Hub also has a wealth of images to choose from for various purposes: Docker Hub

Let me know if there are any ways I can improve this template or if you have any suggestions for additional features! Your feedback is invaluable. üåü
